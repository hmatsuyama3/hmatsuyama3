## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2zVr6cu95nF6O4/giphy.gif" width="45px"> Hi, I’m @hmatsuyama3 

My name is Hiroko and I'm a recent TechElevator bootcamp graduate! I'm in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area chasing my dream job as a software developer. 
After 10 years in healthcare - both on the front lines and in management - I'm ready to make the switch! <br>

While I continue to work full time & job search, I'm spending some time coding to try to bridge the gap between what I learned in bootcamp, 
and what employers are looking for in junior developers. :thought_balloon: <br>

:mortar_board: Project completed during my bootcamp are marked private in an effort to preserve academic integrity. Let me know if you want to see them! <br>

:point_right: Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hirokomatsuyama3/)! I would really appreciate if you could write me a quick message that you found me here :)<br>
